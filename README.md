# hflop - Hierarchical Federated Learning Orchestration

## Description 
Orchestrating a hierarchical federated learning (HFL) process with awareness of
the inference workload generated by clients and the inference request 
processing capacity of candidate model serving nodes. This repository includes 
code to solve the respective optimization problem, an HFL system implementation
allowing simultaneous (H)FL training and inference serving, and tools to 
evaluate this approach on a traffic flow prediction use case.

## Structure
- `data`: Tools for dataset processing.
- `experiment`: Code to run hierarchical and non-hierarchical FL setups and at the same time
serve inference requests. Also includes performance measurements.
- `model`: HFLOP optimization problem model and algorithms to solve it.
- `numerical_results`: Results on solving HFLOP on various problem instances.
